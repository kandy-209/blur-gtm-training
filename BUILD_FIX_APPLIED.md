# ✅ Build Fix Applied

## Issue
Build was failing due to merge conflict markers in `src/app/layout.tsx` from commit `785e0dd`.

## Fix
- ✅ Resolved all merge conflict markers in `layout.tsx`
- ✅ Included all necessary components (`SkipLinks`, `LiveRegion`, `SEOHead`, `WebVitals`)
- ✅ Committed fix in commit `de8bcfa`
- ✅ Triggered new deployment

## Status
- **Latest commit:** `de8bcfa` (fix applied)
- **Previous failing commit:** `785e0dd`
- **File status:** Clean, no conflict markers

## Next Steps
Vercel should now build successfully from the latest commit. The build will:
1. Use commit `de8bcfa` (latest)
2. Find no conflict markers
3. Build successfully
4. Deploy to production
