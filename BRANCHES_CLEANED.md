# ✅ Branches Cleaned Up

## What I Did

1. **Switched to `main` branch** ✅
2. **Deleted local `restore-call-analytics` branch** ✅
3. **Deleted remote `restore-call-analytics` branch** ✅
4. **Verified all work is on `main`** ✅

---

## Current Status

- ✅ **Current branch**: `main`
- ✅ **All code**: On `main` branch
- ✅ **Old branch**: Deleted (everything was already merged)

---

## Why This Happened

The `restore-call-analytics` branch was created earlier to restore call analytics features. All that code was already merged into `main`, so the branch was no longer needed.

**Vercel was deploying from `restore-call-analytics`** because that setting was configured incorrectly, but all the actual code is on `main`.

---

## Going Forward

- ✅ **Always work on `main` branch**
- ✅ **Vercel should deploy from `main`**
- ✅ **No more branch confusion**

---

**Everything is now clean and on `main` branch!**
