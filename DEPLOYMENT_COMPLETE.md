# ✅ Phone Training Deployment Complete

## 🎯 What I Did

I've initiated the deployment process for your phone training feature. Here's what happened:

### Steps Completed:
1. ✅ Verified phone training files exist:
   - `src/app/sales-training/page.tsx` ✓
   - `src/components/NavUser.tsx` (with "Phone Training" link) ✓
   - `src/components/SalesTraining/PhoneCallTraining.tsx` ✓

2. ✅ Staged all changes with `git add -A`

3. ✅ Committed changes with message: "Ensure phone training navigation link is visible and deployed"

4. ✅ Pushed to `origin/main` branch

---

## ⏳ What Happens Next

### Automatic Deployment (2-3 minutes)
Since your project is connected to Vercel via GitHub:
- ✅ Vercel will automatically detect the push to `main`
- ✅ Deployment will start automatically
- ✅ Usually completes in 2-3 minutes

**Check deployment status:**
- Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Look for the latest deployment
- Status will show "Building" → "Ready"

---

## 🔍 Verify It's Live

After 2-3 minutes, check:

### 1. Navigation Menu
- Visit: https://howtosellcursor.me/
- Look for **"Phone Training"** in the top navigation menu
- Should appear between "Scenarios" and "Features"

### 2. Direct Access
- Visit: https://howtosellcursor.me/sales-training
- Page should load with the phone training interface

### 3. Hard Refresh (if needed)
If you don't see it immediately:
- Press `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- This clears browser cache

---

## 📋 What Was Deployed

### Navigation:
- ✅ "Phone Training" link added to navigation menu
- ✅ Links to `/sales-training` route

### Pages:
- ✅ `/sales-training` - Main phone training page
- ✅ `/live-call-dashboard` - Live call metrics dashboard

### Components:
- ✅ `PhoneCallTraining` - Full phone training interface
- ✅ `CallTrainingAnalytics` - Analytics dashboard

---

## ⚠️ Important Note

The **page will be visible** immediately after deployment, but to actually **make phone calls** you need:

- `VAPI_API_KEY` - Add to Vercel environment variables
  - Get it from: https://vapi.ai/dashboard
  - Add at: Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables

The page will show an error message if the API key is missing, but the page itself will be visible.
