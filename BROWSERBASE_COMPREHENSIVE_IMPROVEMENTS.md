#### FAQ 10: "What is Stagehand and how does it work with Browserbase?"
> "Stagehand is Browserbase's open-source SDK that converts natural language instructions into browser actions, enabling agentic workflows without complex automation scripts. Stagehand v3 uses native CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) for 44% faster execution. Core primitives include: Act (perform natural language actions), Extract (structured data extraction), Observe (discover elements for self-healing), and Agent (coordinate multi-step workflows). Stagehand includes automatic action caching that makes subsequent runs 10-15x cheaper by converting LLM-driven workflows into deterministic scripts after the first run."

#### FAQ 11: "What is Patchright and how does it help with anti-detection?"
> "Patchright is Browserbase's specialized Chromium fork optimized for AI agents. It includes stealth capabilities that randomize behavior and interaction patterns to evade bot protection from Akamai, Cloudflare, and other services. Patchright provides closed Shadow DOM access for direct interaction and supports Cloudflare Signed Agents program for select customers, enabling official bypass of Cloudflare using Browserbase Identity."

#### FAQ 12: "What is Director 2.0 and Skills?"
> "Director 2.0 is Browserbase's no-code application for non-developers that records user interactions and exports them as repeatable Stagehand code. It handles complex multi-site workflows and includes Human-in-the-Loop Live View iFrame for real-time oversight. Skills is Browserbase's "API for Anything" feature that transforms any website into a reusable API using natural language descriptions, enabling integration with websites that lack official APIs."

#### FAQ 13: Enhanced "What are Browserbase use cases?"
> "Browserbase is used for web scraping at scale, browser automation, automated testing, data extraction, CI/CD integration, and enterprise browser operations. Specific enterprise use cases include: CRM & Sales Operations (automating Salesforce/HubSpot workflows), Merchant Onboarding (reducing 2-week processes to 1 day), Healthcare (HIPAA-compliant monitoring saving 8,000+ manual hours), Market Intelligence (crawling millions of domains with advanced stealth), and Website Optimization (parallel workers for code extraction and A/B testing).
