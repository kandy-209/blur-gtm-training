## 📝 Test Files Found

**55 test files ready:**
- Component tests
- API route tests  
- Library/utility tests
- Integration tests

## 🛠️ Available Commands

```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:watch          # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage       # Coverage report
npm run test:ci            # CI mode

npm run test:a11y         # Accessibility check
npm run build             # Verify build
```

## 🔍 What to Check

After running tests:

1. **Test Results**
   - How many passed?
   - How many failed?
   - What failed?

2. **Coverage**
   - Overall percentage?
   - Which files need more tests?

3. **Errors**
   - Any TypeScript errors?
   - Any runtime errors?
   - Any test failures?

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Run tests** → See current status
2. **Fix failures** → Address issues
3. **Add coverage** → Write more tests
4. **Improve quality** → Enhance tests
5. **Automate** → Set up CI/CD

## ✨ You're All Set!

Everything is configured and ready. Just run:

```bash
npm test
```

And let's see how we're doing! 🎯
